#Test Frameworks
Angular - Jasmine, Karma & Selenium
Spring REST Services - Cucumber & Selenium( please avoid using your custom test frameworks )

*#Note:- Benifits of BDD approach*

1.  Strong collaboration. With BDD, all the involved parties have a strong understanding of the project and they can all have a role in communication and actually have constructive discussions. 

2.  High visibility. By using a language understood by all, everyone gets strong visibility into the project’s progression.

3.  More confidence from the developers' side. Teams using BDD are in general much more confident that they won’t break the code, and have better predictability when it comes to their work.

4.  Lower costs. By improving the quality of the code, you are basically reducing costs of maintenance and minimizing the project’s risks.
